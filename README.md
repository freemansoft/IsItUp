# Is It Up

This Chrome plugin displays the status of a set of web applications organized in a grid pattern.
It is intended to act as a dashboard for web applications that are deployed across various enviornments.
Environments could be SDLC lifecycle environments, Development, Production, etc or,
they could be various data centers or enpoints when applications are deployed in multiple locations.

The extension has no intrinsic understanding of the meaning of rows and columns.
Row and column usage described above is a convention that works when monitoring many andpoints across < 10 environments.
The configuration and meaning of rows and columns is flexible and is up to the user.

## Display Elements

### Customizable Dashboard Title

The dashboard title can be set in the configuration file. See sample json.

### Cell Contents

Each cell contains

- An icon the that represents the return of the last call to that service.
- A refresh icon that will re run the query to this endpoint.
- Any number of supporting links. These are often links to documentation other dashboards or other environmental tools.

This image shows a primary link with a 200 return code, the refrish link and helper links to Splunk and AppDynamics

## Dashboard Image Hints

You will want small images, preferrably smaller than the result code icons.  
Google has a tool that can turn a website favicon into a standard image.
This (slightly hacked up) url shows how it can be done. Replace foo.com with your URL.

- https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=foo.com
